Project created by Rodrigo de Godoy Domingues Uberl√¢ndia - MG - Brazil 04/12/2015

Script to retreive Papers3 documents and generate tinderbox like XML. The XML is not tinderbox complete, it is aimed to be pasted into existing tinderbox project. Prototypes are being ignored for some reason when opening tinderbox. Their entries are erased.

Generates the following structure:

References Papers Books For each book, book chapters when available Websites Keywords Every Keyword present in Papers3 Documents that contains the keyword Authors Every author present in Papers3 Publications the Author wrote

Every note color depends on the rating assigned in Papers3 5 stars: Green 4 stars: Blue 3 stars: Yellow 2 stars: orange 1 star: Red 0 star: White 0 star + flagged: Grey

A tinderbox template file is provided for reference
Line 847 of the template file is suggested to paste the code generated by the script.

TODO: Generate the whole tinderbox document 
TODO: Improve the user interface (so far just 2 dialogs 1 to inform the process is about to begin and other to inform the completion)
TODO: Checkout the time out in application (Papers 3) error. This is my very first applescript, it surelly is my fault in some misunderstanding of things 
TODO: Improve code documentation
